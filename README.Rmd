```

Excerpt from the [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/) data. This R data package provides the data as a data frame (as `tbl_df`, if you're using [`dplyr`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr)) and in tab delimited form. Package includes premade color schemes for the countries and continents.

The `gapminder` data frame includes six variables, ([Gapminder.org documentation page](http://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/)):

| variable    | meaning                  |
|:------------|:-------------------------|
| country     |                          |
| continent   |                          |
| year        |                          |
| lifeExp     | life expectancy at birth |
| pop         | total population         |
| gdpPercap   | per-capita GDP           |

Per-capita GDP (Gross domestic product) is given in units of [international dollars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geary%E2%80%93Khamis_dollar). From Wikipedia:

> [...] the international dollar is a hypothetical unit of currency that has the same purchasing power parity that the U.S. dollar had in the United States at a given point in time

In `gapminder`, the currency matches the US dollar in 2005.

In `gapminder` there are 12 rows for each country, i.e. complete data for 1952, 1955, ..., 2007. It's a subset of the `gapminder_unfiltered` data frame, which doesn't have the draconian filtering and is therefore about twice as large.

### Install and test drive

Install `gapminder` from CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("gapminder")
```

Or you can install `gapminder` from GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jennybc/gapminder")
```

Load it and test drive with some data aggregation and plotting:

```{r test-drive}
library("gapminder")

aggregate(lifeExp ~ continent, gapminder, median)

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("dplyr"))
gapminder %>%
    filter(year == 2007) %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarise(lifeExp = median(lifeExp))
    
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "hotpink") +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0), alpha = 1/4)
```

The package also includes two color schemes, `country_colors` and `continent_colors`. See an image of the full scheme at the bottom of this page. Here's how to exploit the country color scheme in your own graphs, using base graphics:

```{r demo-country-colors-base}
# using country_colors with base graphics

# for convenience, integrate the country colors into the data.frame
gap_with_colors <-
  data.frame(gapminder,
             cc = I(country_colors[match(gapminder$country,
                                         names(country_colors))]))

# bubble plot, focus just on Africa and Europe in 2007
keepers <- with(gap_with_colors,
                continent %in% c("Africa", "Europe") & year == 2007)
plot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, gap_with_colors,
     subset = keepers, log = "x", pch = 21,
     cex = sqrt(gap_with_colors$pop[keepers]/pi)/1500,
     bg = gap_with_colors$cc[keepers])
```

With `ggplot2`, you can use the country colors by providing `country_colors` to `scale_color_manual()` like so:

```{r scale-color-manual, eval = FALSE}
... + scale_color_manual(values = country_colors) + ...
```

Here are some `ggplot2` examples:

```{r demo-country-colors-ggplot2}
library("ggplot2")

# simple line plot for 5 countries
h_countries <- c("Egypt", "Haiti", "Romania", "Thailand", "Venezuela")
h_dat <- droplevels(subset(gapminder, country %in% h_countries))
h_dat$country <- with(h_dat, reorder(country, lifeExp, max))
ggplot(h_dat, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = country)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))

ggplot(subset(gapminder, continent != "Oceania"),
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country, color = country)) +
  geom_line(lwd = 1, show_guide = FALSE) + facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  scale_color_manual(values = country_colors) +
  theme_bw() + theme(strip.text = element_text(size = rel(1.1)))

gap_bit <- subset(gapminder, year == 2007 & continent != "Oceania")
gap_bit <- gap_bit[with(gap_bit, order(continent, -1 * pop)), ]

ggplot(gap_bit, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop)) +
  scale_x_log10(limits = c(150, 115000)) + ylim(c(16, 96)) +
  geom_point(pch = 21, color = 'grey20', show_guide = FALSE) +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 40) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) + coord_fixed(ratio = 1/43) +
  aes(fill = country) + scale_fill_manual(values = country_colors) +
  theme_bw() + theme(strip.text = element_text(size = rel(1.1)))
```

### Description of the dataset

I have used this excerpt in [STAT 545](http://stat545-ubc.github.io) since 2008 and, more recently, in [R-flavored Software Carpentry Workshops](http://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/) and a [`ggplot2` tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial). I've been amazed at how useful and durable this dataset is for teaching data analysis with R.

Description:

  * `r nrow(gapminder)` observations; fills a size niche between `iris` (150 rows) and the likes of `diamonds` (54K rows)
  * `r ncol(gapminder)` variables
    - `country` a factor with `r nlevels(gapminder$country)` levels
    - `continent`, a factor with `r nlevels(gapminder$continent)` levels
    - `year`: going from 1952 to 2007 in increments of 5 years
    - `pop`: population
    - `gdpPercap`: GDP per capita
    - `lifeExp`: life expectancy

There are 12 rows for each country in `gapminder`, i.e. complete data for 1952, 1955, ..., 2007.

The two factors provide opportunities to demonstrate factor handling, in aggregation and visualization, for factors with very few and very many levels.

The four quantitative variables are generally quite correlated with each other and these trends have interesting relationships to `country` and `continent`, so you will find that simple plots and aggregations tell a reasonable story and are not completely boring.

Visualization of the temporal trends in life expectancy, by country, is particularly rewarding, since there are several countries with sharp drops due to political upheaval. This then motivates more systematic investigations via data aggregation to proactively identify all countries whose data exhibits certain properties.

### How this sausage was made

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Data cleaning code cannot be clean. It&#39;s a sort of sin eater.</p>&mdash; Stat Fact (@StatFact) <a href="https://twitter.com/StatFact/status/492753200190341120">July 25, 2014</a></blockquote>

The [`data-raw`](data-raw) directory contains all of the scripts used to extract the data from the Excel spreadsheets downloaded from [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org) in 2008 and 2009. All underlying and intermediate data is there as well, going back to the Excel files themselves.

I explicitly use this package to teach data cleaning, so have refactored my old cleaning code into several scripts and also include compiled Markdown report. In hindsight, I wouldn't necessarily clean it the same way again (and I would download more recent data!), but at this point there is great value in reproducing the data I've been using for ~5 years.

### Plain text delimited files

I make available two plain text, tab delimited `.tsv` files:

  * [`gapminder.tsv`](inst/gapminder.tsv): the same dataset available via `library("gapminder"); gapminder`. Each of the `r nlevels(gapminder$country)` countries presents complete data for 12 years: 1952, 1957, ..., 2007.
  * [`gapminder-unfiltered.tsv`](inst/gapminder-unfiltered.tsv): the larger dataset that, __when filtered__, yields [`gapminder.tsv`](inst/gapminder.tsv). Available via `library("gapminder"); gapminder_unfiltered`. I have NOT filtered for the years 1952, 1957, ..., 2007, and I retain countries with incomplete data.
  
The main package dataset has `r nlevels(gapminder$country)` * 12 = `r nrow(gapminder)` rows, whereas the larger, unfiltered dataset contains `r nrow(gapminder_unfiltered)` rows, almost twice as much data.

Here in this repo, these delimited files can be found:

  * in the [`inst/`](inst) sub-directory
  
Once you've installed the `gapminder` package they can be found locally and used like so:
  
```{r}
gap_tsv <- system.file("gapminder.tsv", package = "gapminder")
gap_tsv <- read.delim(gap_tsv)
str(gap_tsv)
gap_tsv %>% # Bhutan did not make the cut because data for only 8 years :(
  filter(country == "Bhutan")

gap_bigger_tsv <- system.file("gapminder-unfiltered.tsv", package = "gapminder")
gap_bigger_tsv <- read.delim(gap_bigger_tsv)
str(gap_bigger_tsv)
gap_bigger_tsv %>% # Bhutan IS here though! :)
  filter(country == "Bhutan")
```

## Color schemes

Continent specific colors were selected from `RColorBrewer` palettes.

These were then expanded into a larger set of colors to cover all the countries in each continent, where darker colors correspond to countries with a larger population.

The schemes are provided as named character vectors:

```{r}
head(country_colors, 4)
head(continent_colors)
```

and as tab delimited files: [`continent-colors.tsv`](inst/continent-colors.tsv) and [`country-colors.tsv`](inst/country-colors.tsv).

The country scheme is available in this repo as [PNG](data-raw/gapminder-color-scheme-ggplot2.png) and [PDF](data-raw/gapminder-color-scheme-base.pdf).
