## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I:

* Do not begin the Description field with "This package ..." but instead with "An excerpt of the data ...".

In a previous submission, I made these changes:

* Reference Gapminder.org in the Description field of DESCRIPTION file. It was
already provided in the URL field.
* Mention that the data is for specific countries, before I describe the variables, e.g. GDP per capita.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.1.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Gapminder (2:8, 6:29)
  capita (6:72)

I can affirm that my spelling of "Gapminder" and "capita", as in "GDP per capita", is intentional and correct.
