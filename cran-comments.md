## Update

This is an update of a data package. In this version I:

* Add the tbl_df class to the gapminder data frame provided by this package, which is advantageous for users of the dplyr package.
* Change the population variable in the main data frame from numeric to integer.
* Add a less filtered version of the original data as a new data frame.

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.2.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs.
