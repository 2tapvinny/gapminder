## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.1.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

* Maintainer: 'Jennifer Bryan <jenny@stat.ubc.ca>'
New submission
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Gapminder (2:8, 6:29)
  capita (6:72)

It's my impression that 1 NOTE is inevitable at first submission.

I can also affirm that my spelling of "Gapminder" and "capita", as in "GDP per capita", are intentional and correct.
